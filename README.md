# AstolfoMod

Just a nice and ridiculous mod adding bunch of astolfo related things into the game. 

## Setup
For setup instructions, please refer to [stationapi-example-mod page](https://github.com/calmilamsy/stationapi-example-mod).

There is no Fabric-API for beta 1.7.3, so this mod uses [StationAPI](https://github.com/ModificationStation/StationAPI).
